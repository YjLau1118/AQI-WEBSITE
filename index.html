                    The country of Malaysia is found in southeast Asia, made up
                    of thirteen states and three federal territories. These are
                    separated by the south china sea into two separate sections,
                    with peninsular Malaysia being the region that it typically
                    associated with the countries name, hosting the capital city
                    of Kuala Lumpur. The other region is located in Borneo,
                    being known as the eastern portion of Malaysia respectively.
                    There are some noticeable discrepancies in the levels of
                    pollution between the two regions. In 2019 Malaysia came in
                    ranked 50th place amongst all the countries of the world,
                    with a PM2.5 rating of 19.36 µg/m³, putting its yearly
                    average into the ‘moderately’ polluted range.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In order for a city or country to be classified as
                    moderately polluted requires a PM2.5 reading anywhere
                    between 12.1 to 35.4 µg/m³, putting Malaysia somewhat at the
                    lower end of this moderate spectrum, however as it can be
                    observed, there are months throughout the year that
                    experience rapid spikes in pollution, and as such it is of
                    importance to take this into account, both in regards to the
                    yearly average rating as well as the causes and appropriate
                    measures that may be taken against it. In terms of how
                    polluted it is in comparison to other countries in south
                    east Asia, it can be seen that Malaysia actually came in
                    with a significantly better placing than many of its ASEAN
                    (Association of South East Asian Nations) neighbors, coming
                    in with a better position ahead of countries such as
                    Thailand, which presented with a ranking of 28th place in
                    2019, Vietnam (15th place) and Indonesia (6th place). This
                    goes to show that whilst Malaysia has a plethora of
                    pollution and haze related issues that it has to deal with
                    year in year out, its neighbors give some perspective of the
                    improvements that it has made over the last few decades of
                    industrial growth, and despite facing many obstacles in its
                    path towards cleaner air, pollution levels could eventually
                    be reduced quite significantly.

                  <p>
                    Some of these aforementioned obstacles include an over
                    reliance on vehicles, a lack of highly efficient public
                    transport systems as compared to other countries (although
                    this is changing rapidly with large amounts of investment
                    going into public transport initiatives and projects) as
                    well as comparatively lax rules regarding types of fuels
                    used as well as heavy fuel subsidies, causing a number of
                    pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide
                    (SO2) to enter into the atmosphere, causing worse US AQI
                    readings as well as an increased level of PM2.5 found in the
                    air, coming heavily from the automobile sector.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers
                    or less, with highly detrimental effects displayed in those
                    who breathe it over long periods of time. With its 50th
                    place ranking worldwide out of 98 countries ranked, it
                    stands as a country that suffers from periods of extremely
                    poor air quality where these PM2.5 levels will climb quickly
                    to dangerous levels, however throughout the rest of the year
                    when Malaysia is absent from these pollution spikes (which
                    when considered, are sometimes out of its control due to
                    transborder smoke issues) the air quality sits at the lower
                    end of the moderate rating, with some cities finding
                    themselves in the ‘good’ rated bracket throughout the
                    majority of the year, and others finding themselves sitting
                    within the World Health Organization’s target reading of 0
                    to 10 µg/m³ during a majority of the months of the year, as
                    recorded in 2019.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When observing some of the cities displayed on the IQAir
                    website, such as the top seven most polluted cities in
                    Malaysia as of 2019, it is evident that the levels of
                    pollution in these cities could be somewhat of a concern,
                    and be bringing down the countries yearly average ranking.
                    These top seven cities, which include ones such as Kuala
                    Lumpur, Putrajaya, Shah Alam and Petaling Jaya to name a
                    few, sat at moderate ratings all year round, with rapid
                    climbs observed in August, followed by a dangerous spike in
                    pollution in the month of September, sometimes spilling over
                    into October but gradually receding afterwards. For cities
                    such as these, especially during the latter part of the
                    year, it is apparent that they suffer from a poorer quality
                    of air, and would be of significant concern for those living
                    there year-round, with preventative measures being of
                    greater importance.

                  <p>
                    With its multiple sources of pollution, there would be a
                    large number of different chemicals, compounds and
                    particulate matter making up the pollution collective that
                    finds itself in the Malaysian air. The main offending
                    pollutants, which would be found in similar quantities in
                    other countries around south east Asia, would be ones such
                    as the previously mentioned nitrogen dioxide, which finds
                    itself being emitted mostly by cars, trucks, buses and other
                    forms of transport. The levels of NO2 found in the air are
                    often a good indicator of how much pollution is coming from
                    vehicles alone, as it is the primary pollutant emitted from
                    cars and other engines. They are so well correlated that in
                    fact areas that have high concentrations of traffic or see
                    large volumes of cars passing through them, incidentally
                    have high levels of NO2 present in the atmosphere
                    surrounding it.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Other primary and secondary pollutants would include sulfur
                    dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), with carbon monoxide
                    finding a majority of its emissions from any fuel burning
                    appliance, unfortunately, and often fatally in many cases,
                    located indoors in people’s homes. These sources would
                    include appliances (often malfunctioning or improperly cared
                    for ones) such as furnaces, water heaters, as well as
                    generators and any variety of wood burning stoves. Carbon
                    monoxide is formed from the improper combustion of carbon,
                    often in environments such as contained or sealed spaces
                    that lack oxygen. As such, when the carbon undergoes
                    combustion, it lacks the normal abundance of oxygen
                    molecules in the air to bind with and form the less deadly
                    and more inert carbon dioxide (CO2), instead forming carbon
                    monoxide, which in turn contributes more to air pollution,
                    being one of the previously mentioned ‘secondary pollutant’.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A secondary pollutant is one that is not emitted directly
                    from a single source, but is instead formed from the
                    reaction between separate chemicals, hence why it is known
                    as a secondary pollutant. As such, primary pollutants are
                    ones that are released directly from their source, including
                    pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic
                    compounds (VOC’s), lead, mercury and other forms of
                    particulate matter. It is important to note that some
                    pollutants can be both primary and secondary at the same
                    time, with examples being nitrogen dioxide and carbon
                    monoxide. Both can be released directly from a polluting
                    source such as a vehicle, or be formed via chemical reaction
                    later on in the atmosphere.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Moving on to the other causes of poor air quality in
                    Malaysia, it is apparent that whilst vehicular emission
                    makes up the majority of pollution found across most of its
                    cities, there are other salient sources as well, which would
                    include ones such as factories and other industrial
                    production areas, construction sites which can release high
                    amounts of finely ground dirt onto the roads and into the
                    air, sometimes containing heavy metals and other tiny
                    particles with detrimental health effects. When a
                    construction site is poorly maintained, the dust and fine
                    particles produced as a natural byproduct can make their way
                    onto nearby roads. This in turn can combine with exhaust
                    fumes, often combining with materials such as black carbon
                    (the primary component of soot and highly damaging to both
                    human health and the atmosphere). Once these fine particles
                    combine in the form of road dust, high volumes of traffic
                    can pass over them and send them billowing up into the
                    atmosphere, further adding to the levels on PM2.5 found in
                    the air and subsequently adding to the list of health
                    effects that can be caused by the inhalation of such
                    substances.

                    Lastly and most importantly, are the huge clouds of haze and
                    smog that come from open burning sources. These can occur
                    locally, with forest areas and large amounts of organic
                    refuse being burnt out in the countryside and rural areas of
                    Malaysia, but the most obvious source being the infamous
                    forest and farmland fires coming from Indonesia, mainly
                    Sumatra, whereby farmers practice the highly illegal slash
                    and burning farming methods, setting fire to crop stubble
                    and large areas of forest or plant land. Whilst this is a
                    quick and effective way of clearing land for farming as well
                    as returning nutrients to the soil, it also has the highly
                    disastrous effect of causing vast amounts of smoke to make
                    their way over to Malaysia, which out of all the countries
                    in the region is hit the most hard by it, due to winds and
                    geographical location, although Singapore can oftentimes
                    suffer the same detrimental effects.

                    Many famous years on records have logged the disastrous
                    effects of these clouds of smoke drifting over to Malaysia,
                    with too many on record to go into detail. Symptoms of these
                    smoke clouds can include heavy smog and haze, reduced
                    visibility in major cities such as Kuala Lumpur, the closure
                    of schools as well as interruption of travel, both local and
                    international. Most important to note is the large number of
                    premature deaths attributed to these haze clouds, with
                    children, elderly and those with a predisposition to
                    respiratory ailments being most vulnerable.

                    Health issues and the risks associated with higher levels of
                    PM2.5 and PM10 in the air are numerous, including a myriad
                    of problems, often primarily affecting the respiratory and
                    cardiovascular systems. When the pollution reaches its
                    highest levels in the air, a number of short-term problems
                    can present themselves. These include symptoms such as
                    increased chance of lung and throat infections, as well as
                    irritation to the skin, eyes and nasal passages. PM10 can
                    cause asthma sufferers to have higher numbers of acute
                    attacks, as well as causing it to develop in individuals who
                    may not have suffered from it before.

                    Sections of the population including young children who grow
                    up exposed to these pollutants and thus breathe them in over
                    prolonged periods of time, can develop a decrease in their
                    overall lung capacity, which can in turn stunt growth and
                    cause developmental issues. Pregnant mothers can also
                    experience birth defects in their children if overexposed,
                    due to the ability of the smaller sized PM2.5 to enter the
                    bloodstream via the lungs and circulate to the rest of the
                    body. Once it has entered the bloodstream, instances of
                    cancer can increase, due to the fine particulate matters
                    ability to permeate deep into the lung tissue and stay
                    there. Along with the increased risk of cancer there is also
                    chances for individuals to develop heart diseases and
                    arrythmias, along with a heightened risk of heart attacks,
                    particularly amongst the elderly or those with preexisting
                    cardiac conditions. Due to the large amount of health
                    problems associated with breathing in elevated levels of
                    pollution, it would be of interest to many people living in
                    Malaysia to take preventative measures in regards to
                    reducing their exposure to the smoke and haze that can fill
                    the skies. These measures may include the wearing of
                    particle filtering masks during particularly bad spells, as
                    well as referring to air quality maps that show daily and
                    hourly updates of the air quality index (AQI), or air
                    pollution index (API) as it is known locally in Malaysia.
                    Such maps are available to view on the IQAir website, as
                    well as on the AirVisual app that delivers up to date

                    When observing the data taken over 2019 in regards to the
                    levels of PM2.5 present in the air, it is seen that in
                    September there is countrywide spikes in pollution that
                    often jump up into the ‘unhealthy’ category, one which
                    requires a fairly substantial PM2.5 reading of anywhere
                    between 55.5 to 150.4 µg/m³ to be classed as such. Five
                    cities are observed as having taken the leap into the
                    unhealthy category, with 17 cities moving up from a moderate
                    rating into the ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’ category.
                    Whilst September is most definitely top of the list in terms
                    of most polluted months, as mentioned before the pollution
                    jump can sometimes begin in august and often times spill
                    over into October, and as such heightened levels of caution
                    should be taken during those three months.

                    As of 2019 the most polluted city in Malaysia caught on
                    record was Putrajaya, coming in with a PM2.5 reading of 22.4
                    µg/m³. Whilst this city narrowly beat out Kuala Lumpur,
                    which came in with a reading of 21.6 µg/m³, there were
                    several months of data missing from the readings, as such
                    the results may be skewed somewhat and Kuala Lumpur may
                    unofficially take the top spot, with the haze and pollution
                    spike in Kuala Lumpur being far more prominent than that of
                    Putrajaya’s. However, with its extremely close proximity to
                    Kuala Lumpur, it stands to reason that Putrajaya will have
                    very similar levels of pollution, with the effects of
                    high-level vehicle usage as well as the industrial sector
                    playing a large part in the levels of ambient pollution that
                    the city sees round the course of the year. But as it stands
                    with the average taken from yearly readings of PM2.5,
                    Putrajaya still takes the top spot of most polluted cities
                    recorded in Malaysia as of 2019.
